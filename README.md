Positive plant interactions are common in high ecosystems that are resource limited and have high abiotic stress such as deserts. Shrubs commonly facilitate annual plants by providing favourable microclimatic conditions and reducing herbivory. It is expected that the strength and mechanism of these positive shrub-annual interactions will change with aridity in desert ecosystems. Thus, a large scale experiment is needed to determine how desert shrubs influence annual biodiversity along a regional gradient of precipitation.
